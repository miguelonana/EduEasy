contenu :Students have become the teachers in a global lesson takeover, designed to highlight the importance of climate education.

Across 20 countries, pupils have replaced their teachers today to lead lessons with up-to-date climate science in an effort to focus more on the lack of climate awareness in schools.

‘Teach the Teacher’, a student-led campaign, is being initiated by climate organisations SOS-UK, Mock COP26, EARTHDAY.ORG and Educational International.

The campaign calls for climate education to be “integrated, mandatory and assessed throughout the education system, by embedding it in education policy and teacher training across the globe”.
